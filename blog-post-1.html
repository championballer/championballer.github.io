            <h2>I read Seth Rogen's Yearbook, and here are my thoughts around it</h2>
            <p>Published on: <time datetime="2023-12-09">December 9, 2023</time></p>
            <p>The book is a set of anecdotes from Seth Rogen’s life rather than a full fledged autobiography. Its super entertaining and funny. This was majorly due to the incidents that are told and the way Seth tells them. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to everyone. That said, this book isn’t heavy on learnings or guidance. </p>

<p>One of the key themes of the book was around the stigma associated to substances like weed, acid and MDMA. Seth has tried to reason around their use, and how they are additive in some people’s journeys. He talks about how alcohol is much more harmful than these substances still consumed many orders more than these substances. He dictated a lot of funny (some dangerous) incidents involving him and the people around him around the different substances.</p>

<p>The chapter that really stayed with me was the one around Anti-Semitism and how influential social media has been around fake narratives around the same. Seth talks about how the verification process on Twitter is based around endorsement, and how those posts are amplified compared to others. Also how Twitter (Jack Dorsey specifically) did not take away the verified status of a lot of accounts which were known to spread such sentiments, and that indirectly led to their promotion and in a way responsible for the most gruesome mass shooting on Jews in America.</p>

<p>Another key point in the book is around the release of the movie Interview, wherein Barack Obama came in support of the movie despite pressures from North Korea on how Kim Jong Un had been portrayed. That entire excerpt is pretty awesome.</p>

<p>Also thanks to this book, I found Eminem’s performance from 2011 at the Grammy’s along with Bound 3 which is absolutely hilarious. Also came across Interview which seems like an interesting movie.</p>
